# 👋 Hey, I'm Pradyumn

Product Manager who loves building **AI-powered**, **data-driven** products across **fintech, collections, and insurance**.  
I enjoy solving messy problems, experimenting with new ideas, and turning insights into real business impact.

### 🚀 A bit about me
- Delivered **$44M+** in collections impact across FY23–25 by driving digital engagement for Amex & JP Morgan.
- Built an in-house **AWS + SendGrid email platform** saving **$600K/year** in vendor costs.
- Boosted insurance partner conversions by **40%** for ICICI Lombard (iPartner app).
- Background in data, ML, and software engineering — so yes, I speak *product* AND *tech* comfortably.
- Currently exploring how AI can reshape credit, collections & customer engagement.

### 🛠️ What I’m good at
- Product strategy, roadmapping, experimentation (A/B testing, OKRs, RICE)
- Data-led problem solving (SQL, dashboards, KPIs, funnels)
- AI-integrated product flows (ChatGPT, conversational journeys, automation)
- Working with cross-functional teams across US, EMEA & India

### 📂 What you’ll find here
